			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>
				This website showcases some of the flora and fauna that you should keep an 
				eye out for as you explore the natural sites of Star Valley. Some are 
				hazardous, some are common, and some are unique. 
				Where is Star Valley?
				It is located on the west side of Wyoming, between the Salt River Range and
				the Webster Range. The landscape is much different than most of Wyoming. 
				Rather than hills, wind, and sagebrush, it has mountains with pines and aspens 
				on each side and a wide field of grasses and rivers between them. Where the 
				name came from is a bit of a mystery. The general consensus is that it was 
				originally name “The Star of Valleys” because of its beauty to Latter-Day 
				Saint Pioneers, many of which were its first settlements.

			<h3>Flora</h3>
			<p>
        		Stinging Nettle: A widespread plant with small stinging hairs on its stems 
        		and leaves. Gives an itching, burning sensation and inflammation when 
        		touched. Their leaves have many serrations at their edge, and the leaves 
        		grow in pairs, one on opposite sides of the stem.
        		Lodgepole Pine: A conifer that is not common in most of Wyoming. It can be 
        		found in places such as Yellowstone and of course Star Valley. Strangely, 
        		these trees are fire-dependent species meaning they grow best after a 
        		forest fire. While other tree populations tend to struggle after a fire, 
        		the Lodgepole populations have a net increase because of the fire.
        		Giant Red Indian Paintbrush: A rare wildflower to find in Wyoming but 
        		easily recognizable. They grow a little over 2 feet tall and have green 
        		leaves, purple stems, and red flowers. These plants are parasitic to other 
        		plants and form many connections via their roots. Due to this, they cannot 
        		be transplanted. These plants are also the source of defensive compounds 
        		that some insect larvae can extract and use it as a deterrent for predators.

				<h3>Fauna</h3>
				<p>
				  Black Bear: While exploring the forests in Star Valley, you may encounter a 
				  black bear. They are relatively easy to identify, being almost entirely 
				  black. And while the smallest bear species in America, they are the most 
				  widespread. They tend to avoid people and are the least likely bear to 
				  attack; it is always a good idea to carry bear spray as a deterrent for the 
				  exceptions. Besides their strength, they have some other fascinating quirks. 
				  For example, nearly every attempt to relocate them has failed because they 
				  are able to navigate back to their home range even with no familiar landmarks. 
				  They are also frequent tree climbers, a trait few other American bear possesses. 
				  Pika: An animal that looks like a rabbit with short, round ears and no tail. 
				  These can be found on the rocky sides of some of the canyons of Star Valley. 
				  They make their burrows in crevices of rock and spend their days preparing 
				  for winter. Since pikas do not hibernate, they need to store spare hay, 
				  grasses, and forbs in their burrows. It has been observed that they will 
				  sometimes move to a different burrow and ferry their stash to the new home. 
				  For an alarm call, they produce a high, whistling sound before rushing to 
				  their burrow.
				  Great Blue Heron: A bird rarely seen in Star Valley. They usually only 
				  appear while migrating before or after winter. Since there are many rivers 
				  and ponds, they are pretty easy to spot when the stop by. Most of their 
				  diet consists of fish which their bodies are well equipped to hunt. A 
				  heron’s primary hunting strategy is to stand in or near the water and to 
				  quickly grasp its prey when within reach. Sometimes, they dive from a perch 
				  or even mid- flight if the spot potential food.
