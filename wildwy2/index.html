            This website showcases some of the flora and fauna that you should keep an 
            eye out for as you explore the natural sites of Star Valley. Some are 
            hazardous, some are common, and some are unique.

                    Where is Star Valley?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    It is located on the west side of Wyoming, between the Salt River Range and
                    the Webster Range. The landscape is much different than most of Wyoming. 
                    Rather than hills, wind, and sagebrush, it has mountains with pines and aspens 
                    on each side and a wide field of grasses and rivers between them. Where the 
                    name came from is a bit of a mystery. The general consensus is that it was 
                    originally name “The Star of Valleys” because of its beauty to Latter-Day 
                    Saint Pioneers, many of which were its first settlements.
