                        <p>
                            While exploring the forests in Star Valley, you may encounter a 
                            black bear. They are relatively easy to identify, being almost entirely 
                            black. And while the smallest bear species in America, they are the most 
                            widespread. They tend to avoid people and are the least likely bear to 
                            attack; it is always a good idea to carry bear spray as a deterrent for the 
                            exceptions. Besides their strength, they have some other fascinating quirks. 
                            For example, nearly every attempt to relocate them has failed because they 
                            are able to navigate back to their home range even with no familiar landmarks. 
                            They are also frequent tree climbers, a trait few other American bear possesses.
